<h2 align="center">Self-hosting</h2>

**We ask you to please not host your own instance of PruneBot.** Even though our license allows it, self-hosted instances of the bot have brought us a lot of headache in the past. If you're considering self-hosting, please [try the official instance of the bot first](https://github.com/mashwishi/PruneBot/#). If you have any concerns about the security of our instance, please contact us. We'd love to talk and answer any questions you have.

> If you're really really really going to self-host the bot, please [read our license](https://github.com/mashwishi/PruneBot/blob/master/LICENSE) first, and be aware that we don't provide any self-hosting support. **You'll be on your own.**
